# 🔗 WarrantyChain  
### Blockchain-Based Digital Warranty & Ownership Verification System

WarrantyChain is a decentralized Web3 application that securely stores product warranty and ownership details on the blockchain.  
It enables instant verification, fraud prevention, QR-based validation, and secure ownership transfer.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Secure blockchain storage (Solidity Smart Contract)
- 🧾 Digital warranty registration
- 👤 Ownership verification
- 🔄 Secure ownership transfer
- 📜 Ownership history timeline
- 📅 Warranty validity & days remaining calculation
- 📱 QR-based product verification
- 📄 Downloadable verification certificate (PDF)
- 💳 MetaMask wallet integration
- 🌐 Public verification page (via QR link)

## 🧠 System Architecture

WarrantyChain follows a decentralized Web3 architecture:

User → Frontend (React + Ethers.js) → MetaMask → Smart Contract → Blockchain

• Smart contract stores warranty and ownership data immutably  
• Frontend interacts using Ethers.js  
• MetaMask handles authentication and transaction signing  
• QR verification allows public validation without wallet  

This ensures transparency, security, and tamper-proof record keeping.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Register Product → Stored on blockchain  
2. Verify Warranty → Fetch data from blockchain  
3. Verify Ownership → Shows current owner & history  
4. Transfer Ownership → Securely updates ownership  
5. QR Scan → Opens public verification page  
6. Download Certificate → Generates official PDF  

All transactions are recorded immutably on blockchain.

## 🚀 Local Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/K-Deepak1610/WarrantyChain.git
cd WarrantyChain
```
### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

If frontend is separate:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
### 3️⃣ Start Hardhat Node

```bash
npx hardhat node
```
### 4️⃣ Deploy Smart Contract

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
### 5️⃣ Start Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```
## 📱 QR Verification

Each product generates a QR code containing a verification link.

Scanning the QR:
- Opens verification page
- Fetches blockchain data
- Displays ownership & warranty status
- Allows PDF certificate download
